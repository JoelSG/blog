Blog post authors post code associated with their blog entries here. 

Each author's code is maintained by them in the epynomous directory.

Be sure that the title of the blog post you're interested in matches
the first 10 characters of the commit checksum. The files will change
between blog posts and functions/commandline pairs that work in one 
commit may fail in a different commit.

Enjoy!

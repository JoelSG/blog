Along the lines of the last six weeks of winter, this is but a quick
survey of returns on natural gas from that last trading day in January
to 30 trading days later. 

This is the first time the endpoints() and apply.monthly() methods have 
been used (R) and effort is made to make the code sparse and readable. I
know, isn't that always the goal?

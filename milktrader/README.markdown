Natural gas has had a significant sell-off and I thought it would be interesting to 
see how frequent these selloffs have been. Data was in an annoying xlsx format from EIA.gov.
No worry, R was able to convert it. Getting a data.frame into an xts object is a royal pain, 
quite frankly, but the code for it is now preserved. 

Turns out that 8 times out of 85 the next day return was 0.

Conclusion, there is no edge to go either way here and the potential for a big move
is signficant, and if you're on the wrong side ...

By the way, natty is a pink flamingo.

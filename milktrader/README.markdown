Black Friday is such a cool name for the biggest shopping day of the year, especially
since Black Monday is the worst day for markets.

To get Black Friday returns, I've turned to doing everything in R. I'm using the .index
method. I've also downloaded historical Thanksgiving dates from a website as a cross-check
against my R results. The checking was manual since there are only 61 days to consider.

To process the website data, I've written a Python script coupled with some sed and awk.

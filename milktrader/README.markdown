Ah, the golden cross. Markets tend to be less volatile in bull 
markets and this is a quick study on what the return distribution 
looks like for next-day, 5-day (week), 30-day (six weeks) and
126-day (six months).

I'm going to calculate returns by putting the close for the 
relevant time frame on the same row as the close for what day
is of interest. This is a departure from the exp(sum of log returns) -1
approach that I've been so fond of in the past.

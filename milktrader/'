Strange thing happened this week. Gold sold off more than 5% and SPX was down.

I have a problem with Gold data in that I only paid for some prop data through
2010. This means that I need to search the internet for updated data. I found
a site whose data matched my prop data where my prop data ended so I decided
to scrape it with a python script (included in the directory).

I used the python script to regex out the price (script one) and the date 
(script two). These where piped into a file and then combined with 

  $ paste d2010 p2010

For the seasonal data, I wrote the subset xts object called 't' to the
directory and did the standard bash scripting from commandline.

  $ cat t | cut -c 1-4 | uniq -c | grep -v Ind | awk '{print $2, $1}' > goldyears

Then I read-in the 'goldenyears' file into R for plotting. 

  > years <- read.table("goldenyears")
  > plot(years, col="purple", type="b") 

For the python script, I simply 

  $ chmod +x golddate2010.py
  $ ./golddate2010.py > d2010

And so on for the other three files.

That's about it.
